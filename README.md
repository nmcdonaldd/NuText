# NuText Text Editor
##### by: Nicholas McDonald (<nmmcdona@ucsd.edu>)
A (very) small text editor written in Java. This is a small project I am working on in my spare time for fun. Going to be adding more and more funcitonality!

### What Works
+ Opening a document.
+ Saving a document.
+ Bolding/italicizing/underlining/striking-through text that is already selected.

### What Doesn't Work (Yet)
+ Changing the style of text that you want to write currently (i.e. changing RTF attributes and have it write new text with those attributes. Currently, you have to select the text you want to be changed).

### What is Coming Up
+ Printing capabilities?
+ Different tabs.
+ Font selection.
+ Color selection
+ Menu bar.
