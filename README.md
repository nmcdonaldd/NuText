##### by: Nicholas McDonald (<nmmcdona@ucsd.edu>)
A (very) small text editor written in Java. This is a small project I am working on in my spare time for fun.

### What Works
+ Opening a document.
+ Saving a document.
+ Bolding/italicizing/underlining text that is already selected. (As of 1fde27e4f13ba8fb3de0e34ba9b5c4c308d18560)
+ Font selection. (As of 1fde27e4f13ba8fb3de0e34ba9b5c4c308d18560)
+ Menu bar. (As of b538ed7aec61625ef117bc7d6170f7e3f856c830)
+ Color selection. (As of 75c8a630b83412a423f7d74fbee3d00ed0c980b6)

### What Doesn't Work (Yet)
+ Changing the style of text that you want to write currently (i.e. changing RTF attributes and have it write new text with those attributes. Currently, you have to select the text you want to be changed and then select how you want it changed).

### Possible Updates
+ Printing capabilities.
+ Different tabs.
